# my_leetcode_solutions
i'm on a journey to teach myself python, c#, rust, and javascript ( but mainly c# and python )  
alongside documentation, tutorials, and code analysis, i'm using leetcode for real-world practice  
i've learned something for almost every problem, even the easy level ones  
i plan to look back on these when i'm pro and see how far i've come
